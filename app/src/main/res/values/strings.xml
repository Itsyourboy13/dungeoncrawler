    <string name="how_to_play_text">Movement: Use the directional buttons (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate the dungeon. Explore rooms and avoid getting trapped by walls.\n\nCombat: When you encounter a monster, a battle begins automatically. Defeat enemies to progress, but flee if needed—though it risks your health!\n\nHealth (HP): Monitor your health via the green progress bar. Take damage in battles, and use potions to heal when available.\n\nExperience (XP): Earn XP by defeating monsters, tracked in the yellow progress bar. Gain enough XP to level up, increasing your stats.\n\nPotions: Use potions to restore health (50–75% of max HP) when your supply allows. Collect more by leveling up.\n\nZoom and Pan: Pinch to zoom in/out (1x to 3x) and drag to pan the camera, helping you survey the dungeon.\n\nWinning: Clear all monsters on a level to advance. The game ends if your health drops to zero—submit your score to the leaderboard!</string>
